# splunk-indexer-migration

This project attempts to monitor the process of migrating indexers. This migration can be from hardware to hardware, virtual to hardware, on-prem to cloud, etc.

The package aims to provide visibility into:

  * The workload on the Cluster Master.
  * The progress of migrating a single host.
  * An indication when a host is "done" migrating.
